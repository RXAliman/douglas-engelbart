        <h2 id="academe">Academic Pursuits and Research</h2>
        <p>
            After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Engelbart returned to the United States and enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley. There, he pursued a degree in electrical engineering, focusing on electronics and computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inspired by Vannevar Bush's influential essay "As We May Think," which envisioned a machine that could augment human intellectual capacity, Engelbart became determined to develop technologies that would enhance human-computer interaction.

        <h3>The Augmentation Research Center (ARC)</h3>
        <p>
            In 1962, Engelbart established the Augmentation Research Center (ARC) at Stanford Research Institute (SRI International). The ARC's mission was to develop computer systems that could assist humans in solving complex problems and making decisions.

                <h2>The Computer Mouse</h2>
                <p>
                    One of Engelbart's most iconic inventions was the computer mouse. Developed in 1963, the mouse provided a more intuitive way for users to interact with computers by moving a cursor on the screen.

                <h2>Hypertext</h2>
                <p>
                    Engelbart's concept of hypertext, which allows users to navigate between related information, laid the foundation for modern web browsing and information retrieval systems.

                <h2>The Mother of All Demos</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1968, Engelbart delivered a landmark presentation known as the "Mother of All Demos" at the Fall Joint Computer Conference. This demonstration showcased a wide range of groundbreaking technologies, including the computer mouse, hypertext, videoconferencing, and shared-screen editing. The demo had a profound impact on the computer industry and helped to establish Engelbart as a visionary in the field of human-computer interaction.
